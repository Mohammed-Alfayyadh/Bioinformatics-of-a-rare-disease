# In order to complete the process of filtering my variants I had to merge my VCF files. Because I had to use Sarek pipeline, 
which has two annotation tools embedded in it (VEP and snpEff), I also had to use ANNOVAR annotatation tool. Therefore, each sample now has three VCF files.

# Merge VCF files.

#Merging snpEff with ANNOVAR
bcftools annotate -a snpEff_sample07.vcf.gz -c INFO,^FORMAT/GT ann_sample07.vcf.gz > mergedannot.vcf

# Normally VEP is different, as it produces different numbere of variants. Therefore, the VCF file with the high number of variants has to be the second

bcftools annotate -a sample11_VEP.ann.vcf.gz -c INFO,^FORMAT/GT sample11_snpEff.ann.vcf.gz > mergedannot.vcf

# Now I am merging all the individual files into one VCF file that has all the samples and all the required annotations.

bcftools merge --merge all file1.vcf file2.vcf -O v > final.vcf
