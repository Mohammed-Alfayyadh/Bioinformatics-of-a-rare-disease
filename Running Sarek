The idea is simple, after testing that your pipeline is working fine  nextflow run nf-core/sarek -profile test,singularity , 
you create three files i.e. ( sample.tsv , nextflow.config , launch.pbs). You can change the names of these three however you want but keep the extensions.
You put the three files in a run folder from which then you use the qsub command to run your *.pbs script  i.e.  qsub launch.pbsThe codes I used for the three 
scripts:
The *.pbs script

#!/bin/bash -l
#PBS -N NF-run1
#PBS -l walltime=168:00:00
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=5gb
#PBS -m abe
#PBS -M n9261834@qut.edu.aucd 
$PBS_O_WORKDIR
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
module load java
nextflow run nf-core/sarek -profile singularity

You just have to remove my email and put your email instead, only if you want to get notifications about the start and finish of the submitted jobs. 
The *.config script

params {  
  input = 'sample.tsv'  
  genome = 'GRCh38'  
  tools = 'HaplotypeCaller,mpileup,snpEFF,VEP,CNVkit'
  }
  tower {  
  accessToken = 'your tower token'  
  endpoint = 'https://nftower.qut.edu.au/api'  
  enabled = true
  }
  
  For this you have to put in your tower token. Also, after many failed experiments the above tools should work together. The tools snpEFF and VEP 
  are annotation tools, while CNVkit is a CNVs caller. I am not sure why out of all my failed experiments this one worked, maybe it is the order of the tools 
  or the capitalization of the letters or something else I dont know. But if for some reason your job fails, just add -resume  after singularity in your last 
  line in the .pbs script  i.e nextflow run nf-core/sarek -profile singularity -resume and re launch your  pbs script (without deleting or changing 
  anything inside your run folder).

The *.tsv fileThis is just a file that has tab separated values in it.
