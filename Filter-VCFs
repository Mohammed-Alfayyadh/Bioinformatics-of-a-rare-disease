# My VCF file might have false positive variants
# We often want to seprate SNPs from INDELS, we most of the time are interested in SNPs and because there is a lot of uncertainty associated with indels
in downstream analysis
# depending on my work, most of the time I need to seprate SNPs from INDELS
